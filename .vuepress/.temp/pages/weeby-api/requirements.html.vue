<p>This API is meant to be a tool for Discord Bot Developers. So that means that you need to create a Discord Account in order to apply for a Weeby API Token.</p>
<p>The team will be reviewing most of your bot's features so make sure it is online and the ID provided is a valid Bot ID. Applications that don't meet the requirements will get a DM response letting them know that their application was denied. If you have the feeling that your bot has reached these requirements, feel free to re-apply again.</p>

<p>If you are planning to use this API for your private Discord Bot. You must contact one of the Weeby API Developers explaining the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What your bot does.</li>
<li>Provided Evidence (Images, Videos, etc.)</li>
<li>The ID of your Discord Bot.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>YOUR BOT MUST NOT BE SET TO PUBLIC.</strong> To check this, make sure that the switch is turned off on your bot's application page.</p>

<p>Using this method to get a token, and then making your bot public will result in your API token being revoked.</p>
