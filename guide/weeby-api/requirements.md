# Requirements

This API is meant to be a tool for Discord Bot Developers. So that means that you need to create a Discord Account in order to apply for a Weeby API Token.

The team will be reviewing most of your bot's features so make sure it is online and the ID provided is a valid Bot ID. Applications that don't meet the requirements will get a DM response letting them know that their application was denied. If you have the feeling that your bot has reached these requirements, feel free to re-apply again.

::: tip
Stay in our support server to ensure you can get your token and DM messages from the bot.
:::

#### Public Discord Bots
- Must have at least **25** or more servers.
- Must be **online** when we review it. (Online, Idle, Do Not Disturb)
- The ID of your Discord Bot

#### Discord Bot only for your Server
If you are planning to use this API for a Discord Bot in your server only. You must contact one of the Weeby API Developers explaining the following:
- What your bot does. 
- Provided Evidence (Images, Videos, etc.)
- The ID of your Discord Bot.

**Your bot must not be public.** To check this, make sure that the switch is turned off on your bot's application page. 

::: danger
Using this method to get a token, and then making your bot public will result in your API token being revoked.
