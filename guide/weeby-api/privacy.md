# Our Privacy Policy
If you are interested over what data that Weeby API collects for usage, and improvement:
- When applying for a Token with our Application System (The Discord Bot), Your User ID, Bot ID, Server Count and any other information we may need to ask is collected. This information will only be used for the Application System and nothing else so that we know who is applying, what their bot is about and what they will use the API for.
- Usage Data such as "x" times a Generator Endpoint or the total amount of users registered.
- We never collect and store any data supplied to the query parameters of any endpoint (avatar, username, strings, intensity etc.).
- The team will never look at your token and webhook token, unless you ask one of the developers to do so in the event of your token being compromised (i.e stolen, scammed).
