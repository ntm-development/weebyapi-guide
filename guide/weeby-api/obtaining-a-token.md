# Obtaining an API Token

## Method 1: Using the Weeby API Discord Bot

First, join our [Discord Server](https://weebyapi.xyz/discord) and click "Accept Invite".

You will need to then run the `/apply` command.

Make sure you fill in all the required options. Depending on the condition, an error will return if you don't fill them in properly.

::: warning
Make sure you are eligible for a token. See [this article](./images/requirements) for the requirements to be accepted.

Once you've run the command, an ephemeral response will be sent **that you can only see**. This is to ensure that other bots and users cannot read information about your application, and can then be safely dismissed.

All you need to do now is wait for a response from the bot as the team will be reviewing the applications.

Stay in our support server to ensure that you can receive your Token and DM messages.

You should be on the Application page, and you will be required to fill in the following fields:
- **Client ID** - This is your Discord Bot's user ID, you can find this on the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) page.
- **Server Count** - This is the amount of servers your bot is in at the time of applying. The value must be 25 or more servers, assuming the server count is 25.
- **Reason for Applying** - This is where you need to explain why you want to use Weeby API. Providing something descriptive will help the reviewers understand what your bot does.

Once all the fields are filled, scroll to the bottom and read the important information.
