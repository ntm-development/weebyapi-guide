# Requirements

This API is meant to be a tool for Discord Bot Developers. So that means that you need to create a Discord Account in order to apply for a Weeby API Token.

The team will be reviewing most of your bot's features so make sure it is online and the ID provided is a valid Bot ID. Applications that don't meet the requirements will get a DM response letting them know that their application was denied. If you have the feeling that your bot has reached these requirements, feel free to re-apply again.

## Public Discord Bots
- Must have at least **25** or more servers.
- Must be **online** when we review it. (Online, Idle or Do Not Disturb)
- Must contain the ID of your Discord Bot.

## Private Discord Bots
If you are planning to use this API for your private Discord Bot. You must contact one of the Weeby API Developers explaining the following:
- What your bot does. 
- Provided Evidence (Images, Videos, etc.)
- The ID of your Discord Bot.

**YOUR BOT MUST NOT BE SET TO PUBLIC.** To check this, make sure that the switch is turned off on your bot's application page.

Using this method to get a token, and then making your bot public will result in your API token being revoked.
